# Video Summarization Using Object-Based and Keyframe Extraction

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach to video summarization by combining object-based summarization with keyframe extraction techniques. It aims to enhance the quality and efficiency of video summaries by focusing on semantic relevance and visual significance.

## Key Features
- **Object-Based Summarization**: Identifies key objects in videos to prioritize significant content.
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Extracts representative frames using neural networks for an efficient summary.

## Objective
To develop an advanced video summarization framework that balances computational efficiency with meaningful content representation. The goal is to provide concise, informative, and visually rich video summaries suitable for various applications, including media analysis and content indexing.

## Technologies Used
- Object Verification Models(yolo v8)
- Neural Networks for Keyframe Extraction(transnet V2 ,CIPI , neural network)

## How It Works
1. **Object Detection**: Analyze video frames to identify significant objects able to idetify 80 object.
2. **Keyframe Selection**: Extract frames that best represent the video content. 

## Applications
- Video indexing and search
- Content analysis
- Media summarization
- Highlight generation
